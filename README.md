**Reaper Elo Climbing Guide**

This guide summarizes my extensive journey through the Reaper game mode on my way to Grandma rank. While this guide is primarily focused on Reaper, most of the advice can also apply to Ranger. However, priorities may differ.

This guide consists of two sections:

**1. General Advice for Each Rank:**

Think of this as a mental checklist for every time you evaluate your board and make decisions about buying, rolling, reserving, and positioning. This game has no time restrictions, so be prepared to spend more time on each round as you progress through the ranks.

**Bronze 0 -> Platinum 0:**

In this stage, simply play and learn the game. The Elo adjustments are quite generous, so you don't need to win consistently. Experiment and observe the enemy boards when you lose to get a feel for the "meta" and what most players are aiming for. Focus on understanding the game's theoretical aspects without dwelling too much on perfect execution.

**Platinum 0 -> Diamond 0:**

This is where the game gets interesting, and losses start affecting your Elo. By this point, you should have a clear idea of at least one late-game build you're working towards. Early game can be challenging, so consider transitioning away from the Reaper's pan around rounds 5-7.

**Early Game:**

You may have noticed that the early game with Reaper can be challenging, especially against Rangers with Whetstones. Try to secure a pan by round 2 and sustain through the first 4-5 rounds with food. Then, start building toward your target build.

**Positioning:**

Effective item placement is crucial. Create a mental checklist sorted by priority:
1. Ensure all foods touch the pan.
2. Ensure foods don't touch the same type.
3. Position fanny packs under important items.
4. Maximize items in the coffin.
5. Create additional slots in fanny packs or the coffin by rearranging.

**Potions:**

Pay attention to potions (towers). They are vital for success, especially in the early to mid-game. Learn how to optimize their order of activation.

**Buy and Sell:**

Avoid buying clutter that doesn't directly contribute to your goal. Only acquire items that support your core build and provide defense. Don't hesitate to sell items that become less relevant as your build progresses.

**Offense vs. Defense:**

Consider whether your build needs more damage or survivability. Prioritize items that align with your build's current needs. Keep in mind that survival is often more critical in the early and mid-game.

**Diamond 0 -> Master 0:**

At this point, you have a clear understanding of your builds and priorities. You may have a preferred build, but be ready to adapt if the shop doesn't cooperate.

**Early Game:**

Get creative to save lives during the challenging early game. Improvise if you can't find a pan, and use available items like spears, bucklers, thorns, cards, whetstones, and swords to improve your early game odds.

**Positioning:**

Maintain a mental checklist for optimizations and be willing to invest the time to execute them. Spending time on each board to find improvements is essential for climbing.

**Builds and Meta:**

Be adaptable and strategize based on the circumstances. Having multiple builds on your radar will increase your chances of success. Learn to read the meta and update your internal "power chart" of possible builds regularly.

**Buy and Sell:**

Avoid purchasing clutter and think carefully about how each item contributes to your build. Prioritize items that are essential or enhance your survival.

**Offense vs. Defense:**

Consider whether your build needs more damage or durability and make decisions accordingly. Assess which defensive options are most effective against the expected builds in the current meta.

**Master 0 -> Grandmaster 0:**

Expand your knowledge of various builds and prioritize adaptability in the early game. Take your time, apply what you've learned, and focus on squeezing every possible advantage from your gameplay.

**Grandmaster 0 -> Grandma 0:**

At this stage, focus on fine-tuning your gameplay. Take at least 15 seconds to consider each item in the shop and how it would impact your build. Think deeply about your board and optimize every interaction and synergy.
